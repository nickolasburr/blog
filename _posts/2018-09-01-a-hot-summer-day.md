### Interests

My main interests are:

+ Open source
+ Reading manpages
+ Watching TV
+ Walking for exercise

I do a lot of each.

### Preferences

These are questions I've been asked over the past ~6 years.

> What is your favorite text editor?

Vim. Although I use Sublime occasionally when I need a GUI.

> What is your favorite programming language?

I'll be honest, I hate this question. It's like asking
_what is your favorite power tool?_. I'm a huge fan of
the impact drill but I wouldn't use an impact drill to
cut a 2x4 in half.

My favorite compiled language is C. Akin to SchrÃ¶dinger's cat,
C can be thought of as simulatenously beautiful and abhorrent.

My favorite interpreted language is Ruby. It's intuitive and
elegant, yet powerful and robust.

> What is your favorite OS?

For my personal workstation, macOS. For running applications
in the cloud, Debian. Or Ubuntu.

> What is your favorite VCS?

Git. I've grown to really appreciate the sheer power it offers.
