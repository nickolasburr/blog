This blog post serves as my letter of intent to provide
technical information to people solving problems in the
areas of software, cloud computing, CI/CD, unit testing,
automation, and other related topics.

<!--more-->

The core objectives are as follows:

+ Focused topics (meta topics should be fewer, and labeled as such)
+ Five minute read time (average adult reads at 300wpm, so 1500 words)
+ Solid visual examples (code snippets, screenshots, etc.)
+ One blog post per calendar month
+ One guide per business quarter (three calendar months)

I'm going to try my best to hold to these standards, and I
may add more conditions as I go along, if they make sense.
