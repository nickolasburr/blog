After much speculation regarding the end-of-life date for Magento 1.x, Adobe [announced yesterday](https://magento.com/blog/magento-news/supporting-magento-1-through-june-2020)
they'll provide security updates for post-1.5 Magento 1.x CE and Magento 1.x EE until
June 2020. This end-of-life announcement provides merchants with a sizable window to
make the upgrade to Magento 2.

There has been a lot of uncertainty in the Magento community regarding end of life for
Magento 1.x, so the announcement is a breath of fresh air for merchants and developers
who were worried about timelines.

Nevertheless, there will always be instances where making such an upgrade requires an immense
amount of time, planning, and coordination, not to mention money, putting merchants in a tough
position when weighing options. For merchants unlikely to upgrade before June 2020, you can
take solace in initiatives like [Magento LTS](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts), which
will provide long-term support for Magento 1.x long after June 2020.
