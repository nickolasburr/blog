I'm not sure if other people do this or not, but I regularly
search for my name on Google. In fact, I take it to the next
level. I have an automated browser script that runs inside a
Docker container once a week and emails me the first ten pages
of search results for my name. Overkill? Probably. I guess I'm
just the type of person that likes to have an understanding of
what people see if and when they search for my name. You might
assume it's indicative of someone who has something to hide, but
I assure you, it's just a combination of mild paranoia and subtle
interest in which GitHub repositories Google finds to be the most
stageworthy. The results can be very interesting, at times.

Below are a few links I've verified as references to me on the web,
from different points in my life. It's crazy how life can change so
much in a matter of only a few years.
